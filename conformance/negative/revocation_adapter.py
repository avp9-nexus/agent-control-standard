"""Reference adapter for the revocation vectors, on the terms the suite already sets.

Ships with the vectors for the reason the suite's own reference adapter ships with the
runner: a vector nobody can execute end-to-end is a promise. It extends the shipped
reference adapter rather than replacing it, so every existing vector keeps its existing
answer and only the revocation path is new.

Two failure codes are added, and neither collapses into one already enumerated:

  MANDATE_REVOKED         REJECT        the withdrawal was read and found
  REVOCATION_UNCHECKABLE  UNMEASURABLE  the withdrawal state could not be read

STALE_DECISION cannot carry either. A revoked mandate inside its freshness bound is not
old, and reporting it stale sends an operator to look at clocks. This is the suite's own
rule 1 applied to a second axis: measured-and-wrong and could-not-measure stay apart.
