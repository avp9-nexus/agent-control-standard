# Negative conformance vectors for the enforcement layer

Implements the proposal of issue #29 and the conformance-suite gap of issue #19.

The security value of an enforcement point is defined by its behaviour on inputs that are
*almost* right. This directory holds test vectors for those inputs: actions that are correctly
signed but unauthorized, replayed, stale, bound to the wrong principal, carried by malformed
evidence, or stripped of their observability references.

## Design rules

**1. Two rejection verdicts, never one.** A rejection because evidence was measured and found
wrong (`REJECT`) is a different verdict from a rejection because evidence could not be measured
at all (`UNMEASURABLE`). Both must refuse the action. Collapsing them either lets unmeasurable
inputs fail open, or sends operators hunting for frauds that never happened. Every vector
declares which of the two it expects.

**2. Every category carries a positive control.** Each category includes at least one
almost-identical input that MUST pass. A suite made only of must-reject inputs cannot
distinguish an enforcement layer that works from one that rejects everything. The runner fails
the whole suite if any category lacks its positive control.

**3. Vectors are framework-agnostic.** A vector describes an action, its authorization
evidence, and the state the enforcement point can consult. It never references a specific
implementation. Each implementation provides one adapter (see `runner.py`).

**4. Declared gaps are part of the suite.** Category 3 (expired or revoked mandates) was
covered for expiry only, because the contributing implementation has no revocation
mechanism and vectors for a path never exercised in production would be design fiction.
The gap was stated rather than filled, and contributions from implementations that
exercise revocation were named as the way to close it. `vectors/revocation_vectors.json`
closes it: five negative vectors and two positive controls covering withdrawal inside the
freshness window, an unreachable registry, a registry stale beyond its own declared
publication interval, a back-dated revocation window, and a re-issued mandate naming no
predecessor.

## Failure codes (proposed enumeration)

| Code | Verdict | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CONTEXT_NOT_SUPPORTED` | REJECT | Signature valid, but the consulted state does not carry this action (wrong target, closed auction, exceeded bound) |
| `REPLAY_CONSUMED` | REJECT | The authorization was already used once; one authorization covers one act |
| `STALE_DECISION` | REJECT | The evidence is older than the declared freshness bound |
| `PRINCIPAL_MISMATCH` | REJECT | Approval bound to a different agent, tool, or signing device than the one acting |
| `REFERENCE_MISSING` | REJECT | A required observability reference is absent or zeroed |
| `REFERENCE_MISMATCH` | REJECT | The named reference diverges from the one already bound to this action's context |
| `MALFORMED_EVIDENCE` | UNMEASURABLE | Evidence present but not decodable to the declared shape; consumers must fail closed |
| `ORACLE_UNAVAILABLE` | UNMEASURABLE | The state needed to judge could not be read; absence of measurement is never a pass |
| `MANDATE_REVOKED` | REJECT | The withdrawal was read and found: the authorization was valid when written and has since been withdrawn by its issuer |
| `REVOCATION_UNCHECKABLE` | UNMEASURABLE | The withdrawal state could not be read, or could not be attributed to what is being presented |

`STALE_DECISION` cannot carry either of the last two. A revoked mandate inside its
freshness bound is not old, and reporting it stale sends an operator to look at clocks.
That is rule 1 applied to a second axis: measured-and-wrong and could-not-measure stay
apart, and so do old and withdrawn.

## Vector schema

The eighteen core vectors live as a single array in `vectors/negative_vectors.json`, and the
seven revocation vectors in `vectors/revocation_vectors.json`. Both files share the schema in
`vector.schema.json`, and each is run against the adapter that implements the layer it covers;
the schema below describes one entry.

```json
{
  "id": "neg-cat1-001",
  "category": 1,
  "description": "what makes this input almost right, and why it must fail",
  "input": {
    "action": { },
    "authorization": { },
    "state": { }
  },
  "expected": {
    "verdict": "REJECT | UNMEASURABLE | PASS",
    "code": "one of the enumeration above, absent for PASS",
    "reason_must_mention": ["substring the refusal message must contain"]
  },
  "positive_control": false
}
```

`reason_must_mention` exists because a correct verdict with a wrong reason is a latent bug:
an enforcement point can reject for the wrong cause and pass the suite while hunting the
wrong class of attack.

## Running

```
python conformance/negative/runner.py --adapter your_adapter.py
python conformance/negative/runner.py \
    --adapter conformance/negative/revocation_adapter.py \
    --vectors conformance/negative/vectors/revocation_vectors.json
```

The adapter exposes `evaluate(vector) -> {"verdict": ..., "code": ..., "reason": ...,
"entry_point": ...}`, where `entry_point` names the production entry point the adapter
dispatched through for that vector. The runner exits non-zero on: any verdict mismatch,
any code mismatch (positive controls included), any missing `reason_must_mention`
substring, any category lacking a positive control (a control counts only if it expects
`PASS`), any answer naming no entry point, or any category whose positive controls
resolved through a different entry point than its negative vectors. The last two rules
exist because a suite whose positive controls certify a test double certifies nothing:
an adapter that reads the answer key passes every content check and fails only there.

## Provenance

Vectors are generalized from an enforcement layer running in production since June 2026
(hash-chained decision registries, out-of-band human confirmation, on-chain context checks).
Each rejection code in the enumeration was produced by a real refusal before it was named
here. The field notes behind them are public: https://github.com/avp9-nexus/nexus-art
